        <p>Camino de Santiago 4-Day Tour</p>
        <p>Our "Camino de Santiago 4-Day Tour" is a more serious, advanced route for seasoned riders only. You must have been at least on 2 Moderate Tours to be admitte, as seats are limited and the tour is 4 days long and we want to be sure everyone is able to keep up. Our goal is to keep everyone together, but these are not “no drop” rides. There will not be a “sweep” rider and the group will not wait for those who find their fitness or ability prevent them from catching up fairly quickly at the regroup spots. <br> A breezy 41.2 miles<br> Only $60 a person<br>



        <p>Rides and Routes – All rides leave the shop at 8:30 Saturday morning</p>
